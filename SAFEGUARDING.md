# Safeguarding Policy

This document establishes the non-negotiable safety protocols for all research and deployments involving the NAAS-Agentic-Core toolkit, specifically regarding youth participants.

## 1. Consent & Assent

All research involving human subjects must adhere to strict ethical clearance.

*   **Guardian Consent:** Written, informed consent is mandatory from a parent or legal guardian for all participants under the age of majority (typically 18).
*   **Youth Assent:** In addition to guardian consent, the youth participant must provide affirmative assent to participate.
*   **Right to Withdraw:** Participants and guardians have the absolute right to withdraw consent and have their data deleted at any time, without penalty.

## 2. Supervision Requirements

No automated system is a substitute for human care.

*   **No Unsupervised Sessions:** Minors must never interact with the system without the presence or immediate availability of a trained adult mentor or supervisor.
*   **Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL):** Every deployment or pilot must have a named DSL at the host institution responsible for handling concerns.
*   **Mentor Training:** All supervisors must complete the [Mentor Onboarding Checklist](../toolkit/START_HERE.md) and be vetted according to local institutional policies.

## 3. Incident Escalation Matrix

In the event of a safety concern, use the following matrix to determine the immediate action.

| Risk Level | Definition | Action Required | Timeline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** | Disclosure of immediate harm, abuse, or severe distress. | 1. Intervene immediately to ensure safety.<br>2. Terminate session.<br>3. Report to DSL & Emergency Services (if applicable). | **Immediate** |
| **Medium** | Distress, inappropriate content generation, or behavioral concern. | 1. Pause session.<br>2. Debrief with participant.<br>3. Log incident.<br>4. Notify DSL. | Same Day |
| **Low** | Tech failure, minor frustration, or confusing output (non-harmful). | 1. Assist participant.<br>2. Log technical error.<br>3. Review in weekly meeting. | 24-48 Hours |

## 4. Session Rules

1.  **Safety First:** The physical and emotional wellbeing of the youth always takes precedence over data collection.
2.  **Verify Outputs:** Mentors should help verify model outputs if the participant is confused or distressed.
3.  **No Private Channels:** All communication must occur in observable, sanctioned channels.
4.  **No Publication of Chats:** Raw chat logs are strictly confidential and must never be shared on social media or public forums.

## 5. Training & Documentation

To ensure consistency and safety, the following artifacts must be maintained:

*   **Mentor Onboarding Checklist:** Confirmation that all supervisors understand these protocols.
*   **Incident Log:** A privacy-preserving record of any issues (see `toolkit/INCIDENT_LOG_TEMPLATE.md`).
*   **Emergency Contact List:** A physical and digital list of local emergency contacts and the DSL's contact info, accessible to all mentors.

## 6. Emergency & Referral

If a disclosure of harm occurs:
1.  **Stay Calm:** Listen without judgment.
2.  **Do Not Promise Secrecy:** Explain that you must keep them safe, which may involve telling a designated person.
3.  **Refer:** Pass the information strictly to the Designated Safeguarding Lead or appropriate legal authority aligned with the host institution's policy.
