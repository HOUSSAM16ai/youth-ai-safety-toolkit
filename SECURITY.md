## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the NAAS-Agentic-Core repository, please report it to our team privately.

### How to Report

1.  **Email:** Contact the repository maintainers directly (see profile contact or `SECURITY.md` history).
2.  **Private GitHub Advisory:** If enabled, use the "Report a vulnerability" tab in the Security section of this repository.

### What to Include

*   A clear description of the potential vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the issue (PoC).
*   Any relevant logs or screenshots.
*   The version of the software you are running.

### Our Response

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **72 hours**. We aim to resolve critical security issues as quickly as possible.

1.  **Triage:** We will investigate and verify the report.
2.  **Patch:** If valid, we will develop and test a fix.
3.  **Release:** We will release a security patch or advisory.
4.  **Credit:** We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (with your permission) in the release notes.

## Scope

This policy applies to the core agentic logic, evaluation suites, and documentation within this repository. It does not cover vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies unless the vulnerability stems from our specific usage or configuration.

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

*   Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service.
*   Only interact with accounts they own or have explicit permission to test.
*   Report vulnerabilities to us rather than to the public.

Thank you for helping keep the NAAS-Agentic-Core project safe.
