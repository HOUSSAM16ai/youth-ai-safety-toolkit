# Independence & Transparency

The North African AI Safety Lab (NAAS Lab) is committed to operational and intellectual independence. This document outlines how we maintain neutrality and transparency in our research.

## 1. Research Independence

*   **No Veto Power:** Funding partners, model providers, and hosting institutions do not have veto power over our research findings.
*   **Right to Publish:** We reserve the right to publish critical safety evaluations, vulnerability reports, and negative results.
*   **Conflict of Interest:** All researchers must declare potential conflicts of interest (e.g., equity in AI labs) prior to contributing to evaluations.

## 2. Transparency in Methods

*   **Open Source:** Our evaluation code, prompt templates, and scoring rubrics are open source (MIT License).
*   **Reproducibility:** We strive to make all experiments reproducible by providing versioned datasets (where safe) and clear configuration parameters.
*   **Limitations:** We explicitly state the limitations of our tools (e.g., "This tool does not guarantee 100% safety").

## 3. Data Sharing

*   **Public Data:** Aggregated metrics, anonymised failure patterns, and methodology papers.
*   **Restricted Data:** Raw chat logs and PII are **never** shared publicly. They are only accessible to authorized researchers under strict NDA and ethical clearance.

## 4. Funding Transparency

We will publicly disclose all sources of funding and material support in our annual report and on the project repository.
